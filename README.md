# Speech Recognition Model
This is a PyTorch implementation of a speech recognition model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model is trained on a dataset of audio files and their corresponding labels. The model architecture consists of a bidirectional LSTM layer followed by a fully connected layer. The dataset is loaded using a custom dataset class and processed using a data loader for batching.

# Dependencies
This implementation requires the following Python libraries:

torch
torch.nn
torch.optim
torch.utils.data

# Model Architecture
The speech recognition model is defined by the SpeechRecognitionModel class, which inherits from nn.Module. It has the following architecture:

scss
Copy code
SpeechRecognitionModel(
  (lstm): LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=2, bidirectional=True)
  (fc): Linear(hidden_size * 2, output_size)
)
input_size: Size of the input features for the LSTM.
hidden_size: Number of hidden units in the LSTM.
num_layers: Number of LSTM layers (set to 2 in this implementation).
bidirectional: Whether the LSTM is bidirectional (set to True in this implementation).
output_size: Number of output classes.
The forward method of the model takes an input tensor and passes it through the LSTM layer and the fully connected layer to obtain the output logits.

# Dataset and DataLoader
The dataset is loaded using the SpeechRecognitionDataset class, which inherits from data.Dataset. It takes in audio files and their corresponding labels as input during initialization. The __getitem__ method returns a tuple of audio and label for a given index, and the __len__ method returns the total number of samples in the dataset.

The data is then passed through a data loader, train_dataloader for training and test_dataloader for testing, which batches the data and shuffles it (only for training) to be fed into the model during training and testing.

# Loss Function and Optimizer
The loss function used in this implementation is the Cross Entropy Loss, defined as nn.CrossEntropyLoss(), which is commonly used for multi-class classification problems.

The optimizer used is Adam, defined as optim.Adam(), which is a popular optimization algorithm for training deep neural networks.

# Training and Testing
The model is trained using a loop over the epochs and batches of data from the training data loader. The optimizer is zeroed out using optimizer.zero_grad() before computing the output of the model and calculating the loss. The loss is then backpropagated using loss.backward() and the optimizer is updated using optimizer.step().

After training, the model is tested on a separate test dataset using the test data loader. The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the ground truth labels, and the accuracy is printed at the end.

# Saving the Model
The trained model is saved to a file named "speech_recognition_model.pth" using torch.save() function, which saves the state dictionary of the model containing the learned parameters. This saved model can be loaded later for inference or further training.

Note: Please replace input_size, hidden_size, output_size, audio_files, labels, test_audio_files, test_labels, and num_epochs with appropriate values before running the code.
